# Cardiovascular-risk-prediction-project

This README file provides an overview of the Cardiovascular Risk Prediction Classification Project. The project's goal is to develop a machine learning classification model to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease in individuals based on various health-related features. This document aims to help users understand the project, its objectives, and how to use the provided code and data.

Cardiovascular disease is a significant health concern globally. Accurate risk prediction is essential for early intervention and prevention. This project focuses on building a classification model that can predict whether an individual is at a high or low risk of developing cardiovascular disease based on various health-related attributes such as age, gender, blood pressure, and more.

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

Develop a machine learning classification model to predict cardiovascular disease risk.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
Provide insights into the factors that contribute to cardiovascular disease risk.
Create visualizations to aid in understanding the data and model results.


Usage
Train the classification model using the provided training data.

Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data.

Make predictions on new data or real-time inputs.

Create visualizations to gain insights into the data and model results.
